**Step 1: Initializing a Prisma Project**

- I used the command `pnpm prisma init` to start a new Prisma project. This automatically generated a folder named "prisma" in my project, containing the database schema and other essential configuration files.

**Step 2: Configuring the Database Provider**

- I opened the `schema.prisma` file within the "prisma" folder and configured the database provider. In my case, I selected the "mysql" provider, indicating that Prisma would use MySQL as the underlying database.

**Step 3: Synchronizing the Schema with the Cloud Database**

- I executed the `pnpm prisma db push` command to synchronize the schema defined in Prisma with the cloud database. This ensured that the database structure accurately reflected my Prisma schema.

**Step 4: Generating Prisma Client Artifacts**

- To interact with the database effectively, I generated the necessary artifacts using the `pnpm prisma generate` command. This included generating the Prisma Client, which is an essential tool for programmatically interacting with the database from my application.

**Step 5: Creating the "db" Folder within "src"**

- In order to manage the database connection in an organized manner, I created a folder named "db" within the "src" folder of my project. This folder would serve as the place where I would manage the connection and database operations.
