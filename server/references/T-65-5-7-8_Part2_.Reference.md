## Task Description:

I created resolvers for the "_shift_" entity in the "_resolvers/shift.js_" file. These resolvers were responsible for handling queries and mutations related to shifts, appointments, and comments within the system.

This involved defining **GraphQL schema** types and resolvers for:

1. Creating new shifts, which include setting check-in and check-out times, dates, and related employee information.
2. Creating appointments within shifts, specifying relevant data such as start time, end time, date, title, description, fee, and status.
3. Adding comments on appointments, allowing users to provide additional information or feedback.

## Important:

A key consideration in this task was that the initial implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality was only focused on data insertion. The emphasis was on ensuring that the data schema and inserted records were well-structured, organized, and that the database operated smoothly. Once this verification was satisfactory, subsequent tasks would address the implementation of additional CRUD operations, such as updating, deleting, and editing data records.
