## ISSUES: _"Operating without foreign key constraints"_

https://planetscale.com/docs/learn/operating-without-foreign-key-constraints  
Upon reviewing the recommendations provided by PlanetScale and assessing the current database implementation hosted on their platform, it was identified that the use of foreign key constraints was not recommended. Additionally, it was recognized that there was a need for a more cost-effective and feature-rich database service that aligns better with the project's objectives. As a result, a decision was made to transition from MySQL to PostgreSQL as the database management system and to migrate the database to Supabase as the hosting service.
