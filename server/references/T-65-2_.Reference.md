**Step 1: Accessing PlanetScale**

- I accessed the PlanetScale platform through their website at https://planetscale.com/.

**Step 2: Creating a Database**

- Once inside the platform, I proceeded to create a new database. To do this, I followed these steps:
  - In the PlanetScale control panel, I located the option to create a new database.
  - I chose a name for the database, which in this case was "t65-db".
  - I selected the "US-east-Ohio" region as the geographical location to host the database in the cloud.

**Step 3: Configuring Credentials**

- To ensure that my application can access the PlanetScale database, I configured the necessary credentials. This involves the following:
  - I accessed the ".env" file in my project, which is used to store environment variables and sensitive configurations.
  - I added the connection credentials provided by PlanetScale to the environment variables in the ".env" file. These credentials include information such as the username, password, host, and port of the database.
