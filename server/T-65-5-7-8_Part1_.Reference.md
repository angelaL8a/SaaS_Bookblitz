## Introduction:

To streamline and enhance the efficiency of the application, GraphQL and Apollo Server were chosen as the system for handling data requests and operations. This approach simplifies processes and provides a more efficient way to work with data.

### Steps Taken:

1. **Installing Dependencies for GraphQL and Apollo Server:**

   - The first step involved installing the necessary dependencies for GraphQL and Apollo Server. These dependencies enable the implementation of GraphQL in the application.

2. **Creating the "src/graphql" Folder:**

   - A new directory named "src/graphql" was created to house the GraphQL resolvers and type definitions (typeDefs). This organized structure makes it easier to manage GraphQL-related code.

3. **Configuration in index.js:**

   - Within the "index.js" file, configurations were implemented to run the Apollo Server, which serves as the GraphQL server for the application.
   - To avoid congestion and maintain a clean codebase, all type definitions and resolvers were organized into separate folders: "typeDefs" and "resolvers."
   - These separate folders help modularize the GraphQL schema and resolver implementations, making it more maintainable.

4. **Schema.js for Aggregating Type Definitions and Resolvers:**

   - To simplify the inclusion of all type definitions and resolvers, a "schema.js" file was created.
   - This file aggregates the GraphQL type definitions and resolver functions, allowing for a clean and organized schema setup.

5. **Individual Type Definitions for Various Entities:**

   - Specific type definitions were created for different entities within the application, including users, companies, shifts, and appointments.
   - These type definitions define the structure of data for GraphQL queries and mutations.

6. **Individual Resolvers for Data Retrieval:**

   - Individual resolver files were created for each entity, such as "user.js," "company.js," "shift.js," and "appointment.js."
   - These resolver functions define how data is retrieved for each GraphQL query and mutation related to the respective entity.

7. **Sessions Using JSON Web Tokens (JWT):**

   - JSON Web Tokens (JWT) were implemented to manage user sessions.
   - JWT tokens are stored in the local storage of the client's browser and remain valid for 30 days, providing a secure session management solution.

8. **Random Username and Password Generation:**  
   https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt  
   https://www.npmjs.com/package/slug  
   https://www.npmjs.com/package/@paralleldrive/cuid2
   - A system for generating random usernames and passwords was implemented.
   - The "generate-random-password" utility generates an 8-character random password, which is then hashed using bcrypt for security.
   - The "generate-random-username" utility creates a random username using client data and random characters, avoiding special characters and unnecessary spaces. Slug is used to ensure username validity.
   - These functions are utilized within their respective resolvers to create random usernames and passwords for users or employees when an administrator creates a new user.
