## Install Node.js and configure a development environment for React. Install necessary dependencies

1. **Create React application with Vite:**

   - Followed the guide on [Vite's official website](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) to set up a new React project using Vite, which provides a fast development server and optimized build setup.

2. **Install necessary dependencies:**
   - Installed Tailwind CSS by following the [installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite) specific to Vite projects, enabling efficient styling of components.
   - Installed React Router DOM using the instructions provided in the [official documentation](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial) to manage navigation and routing within the React application.
   - Integrated Zustand by referring to the [getting started guide](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction), enabling state management with a minimalistic approach.
   - Added Tanstack Query for managing API requests by following the installation steps outlined in the [official documentation](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/installation), including setup and configuration.

By completing these steps, I successfully established a development environment for React using Vite and installed the necessary dependencies, including Tanstack Query, React Router Dom, Tailwind CSS, and Zustand, to support the development of the frontend components and features.
